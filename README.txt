Sling ESP blog sample with IKS VIE
----------------------------------

This is a modified version of the Sling ESP blog sample using VIE for editing
posts. You can learn about IKS ViIE on http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/VIE

For simplicity the JCR observation service in the original example has been
ommitted in this project.

WHY THIS SAMPLE?
----------------
This demonstrates how a blog-engine can be adapted to use IKS VIE.


HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
Build this bundle and install it in Sling.

For example, if Sling is running on port 8080 (which happens if you start 
the launchpad/testing module with "mvn jetty:run"), this will build and 
install it:

    mvn -P autoInstallBundle clean install -Dsling.url=http://localhost:8080/system/console
    
To verify that the bundle is correctly installed:

1) http://localhost:8080/apps/espblog/html.esp must return the html.esp 
   script.

2) The console at http://localhost:8080/system/console/bundles must 
    list the bundle named "Sling - ESP blog sample" as active.    

HOW TO TEST
-----------
Start by logging in at http://localhost:8080/?sling:authRequestLogin=true,
using username=admin and password=admin (or use the "login" link on the 
/index.html page).

Once logged in, /index.html should say "you are currently logged in as
user "admin" to workspace "default".

Then, http://localhost:8080/content/espblog/*.html should display the "Sling ESP
blog sample" page, with the Home/Admin/New Post/... menu.

If you get Sling's default HTML rendition instead ("Resource dumped by 
HtmlRendererServlet") that's probably because the "path-based-rtp" bundle
is not installed. Run the above "mvn...clean install" command in the
sling/samples/path-based-rtp folder to install it, and reload the page.

Create a new post using the "New Post" menu.

The post can include an attachment, if that's an image the included
ThumbnailGeneratorService generates thumbnails in different sizes, displayed
on the post's page. This happens asynchronously, so depending on your 
machine's speed the thumbnails might only appear after a few seconds.

The ESP scripts are found under /apps/espblog in the repository.
